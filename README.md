# Ragtag Infrastructure Guide

This is a guide to hosted Ragtag infrastructure, as well as recommendations for projects hosted outside of Ragtag accounts.

Currently, Ragtag has an AWS account and a [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/) instance.

## Ragtag infrastructure goals

- Make deployment easy for developers of all skill levels.
- Cheap hosting during development
- No need for volunteers to pay for hosting
- Price effective production hosting for orgs that need it
- Smooth transition to org-hosted environments

## Recommendations

### Source control

Ragtag GitHub or GitLab

### Early development / proof of concept
